# Workstation Setup

A list of tools, utilities and links that I find useful when configuring a new development workstation.

Looking for a new utility? I always start at [Scott Hanselman's Ultimate Tools List](http://hanselman.com/tools).

###Quick links:

## Git Config

* [.gitignore](https://github.com/TheZenDibbler/setup/blob/master/git/.gitignore) **[VisualStudio]**

   Git ignore file for use with VisualStudio projects. This is a slightly customised version of the .gitignore found [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/VisualStudio.gitignore), but includes an exclusion for the Mac OS X *.DS_Store* files, which is really useful if you run Paralles for Mac and access your Mac filesystem.

## Software

### Text Editor

* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) **[Mac, Windows]**

   Incredible text editor with a myriad of plugins.

### Source Control

* [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads) **[Windows]**

   Git ... and don't forget to setup your [.gitignore](https://github.com/TheZenDibbler/setup/blob/master/git/.gitignore) - this is a slightly customised version of the .gitignore found [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/VisualStudio.gitignore), but includes an exclusion for the Mac OS X *.DS_Store*, which is really useful 

* [Source Tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) **[Mac, Windows]**

   For those rare times when the Git console doesn't cut it, I like Source Tree. There are numerous alternatives, including:
   * [GitHub for Windows](https://desktop.github.com) **[Windows]**
   * [Git Extensions](http://gitextensions.github.io) **[Windows]**

   I don't use Git GUI's enough to know if one is significant;y beter than another.

* [PoshGit](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git) **[Windows]**

   Really nice Git enhancements module for PowerShell.

### File Compare

* [Beyond Compare](http://www.scootersoftware.com) **[Mac, Windows]**

   My all time favourite file and folder comparison tool.

### Terminals

* [Cmder](http://cmder.net)**[Windows]**

   Fabulous console replacement based on [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io). Defaults to Monokai colour theme and allows you to run PowerShell side-by-side with Git Bash and a regular console. Nice.

* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com) **[Mac]**

   Nice `Terminal` replacement. Goes very nicely with the next item ...

* [Oh My Zsh!](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) **[Mac]**

   Zsh command terminal, with some cool features right out of the box and lots of plugins.

### System Utils

* [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.info) **[Windows]**

   Nice free disk usage viewer.

* [Windows SysInternals](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb545021.aspx) **[Windows]**

   Some nice utilities for analyszing Windows system processes and performance. Thikn `Task Manager` on steroids. 

### Networking

* [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) **[Windows]**

   Great free web debugging tool.

* [WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org) **[Windows]**

   Network analyzer.

* [Proxy Switcher](http://proxyswitcher.net) **[Windows]**

   Handy little utility for automatically switching your proxy settings when you're network connection changes. Eg, switching between an ethernet and WiFi connection.

* [Cntlm](http://cntlm.sourceforge.net) **[Mac, Windows]**

   Great tool for accessing Windows NTLM authenticating proxy servers. Also great at working-_around_ NTML authenticating proxies.

### Screen Capture

* [Skitch](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/skitch-snap.-mark-up.-send./id490505997?mt=8) **[Mac]**

   Free (and paid for Pro edition) screen capture tool for Mac, with some basic but nifty annotation tools. Grab it from your local App Store.

* [Snagit](https://www.techsmith.com/snagit.html) **[Windows]**

   Great screen capture tool, although it does a lot more than just grab screenshots. Record video, edit captures plus loads more. Not free though ... if you're just after screen grabs, then:

* [Greenshot](http://getgreenshot.org) **[Windows]**

   Great free screen capture tool for Windows.

### Image Utils

* [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/index.html) **[Windows]**

   Fabulous free image editor for Windows. Customisable through a large number of available plugins. Just be careful to click on the correct link on the download site.

* [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org) **[Mac, Windows]**

   Free Photoshop clone. Available for Windows as well, but I much prefer Paint.NET.

* [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr) **[Mac, Windows]**

   Great utility for transcoding pretty much any video format into any other video format :)
