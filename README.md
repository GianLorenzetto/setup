# Workstation Setup

A list of tools, utilities and links that I find useful when configuring a new development workstation.

Looking for a new utility? I always start at [Scott Hanselman's Ultimate Tools List](http://hanselman.com/tools).

## Windows

* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)

   Incredible text editor with a myriad of plugins.

* [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

   Git ... and don't forget to setup your [.gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/VisualStudio.gitignore)

* [Source Tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com)

   For those rare times when the Git console doesn't cut it, I like Source Tree. There are numerous alternatives, including:
   * [GitHub for Windows](https://desktop.github.com)
   * [Git Extensions](http://gitextensions.github.io)

   I don't use Git GUI's enough to know if one is significant;y beter than another.

* [Cmder](http://cmder.net)

   Fabulous console replacement based on [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io). Defaults to Monokai colour theme and allows you to run PowerShell side-by-side with Git Bash and a regular console. Nice.

* [Beyond Compare](http://www.scootersoftware.com)

   My all time favourite file and folder comparison tool.

* [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.info)

   Very handy free disk usage viewer.


## Mac OS X

* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)

   Incredible text editor with a myriad of plugins.

* [Beyond Compare](http://www.scootersoftware.com)

   My all time favourite file and folder comparison tool.

* [Skitch](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/skitch-snap.-mark-up.-send./id490505997?mt=8)

   Free (and paid for Pro edition) screen capture tool for Mac, with some basic but nifty annotation tools. Grab it from your local App Store.

* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com)

   Nice `Terminal` replacement. Goes very nicely with the next item ...

* [Oh My Zsh!](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

   Zsh command terminal, with some cool features right out of the box and lots of plugins.

* [Source Tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com)

   For those rare times when the Git console doesn't cut it,

* [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr)

   Great utility for transcoding pretty much any video format into any other video format :)
