# Workstation Setup

A list of tools, utilities and links that I find useful when configuring a new development workstation.

Looking for a new utility? I always start at [Scott Hanselman's Ultimate Tools List](http://hanselman.com/tools).

## Windows

## Mac OS X

* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)

   Incredible text editor with a myriad of plugins.

* [Skitch](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/skitch-snap.-mark-up.-send./id490505997?mt=8)

   Free (and paid for Pro edition) screen capture tool for Mac, with some basic but nifty annotation tools. Grab it from your local App Store.

* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com)

   Nice `Terminal` replacement. Goes very nicely with the next item ...

* [Oh My Zsh!](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

   Zsh command terminal, with some cool features right out of the box and lots of plugins.

* [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr)

   Great utility for transcoding pretty much any video format into any other video format :)
